## Overview

![alt text](image.png)

The challenge was to build a coin flipping game. I built this with HTML CSS and JavaScript.

### What I learned

I used this to relearn the basics of JavaScript like conditionals.

### Useful resources

I used [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to help me get the font for this project
I also used [JoshWComeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/) 's website to help me with the animated button.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.

I added an attempts counter and reset button for better user experience
